<h1>Pitch Perfect</h1>

Pitch Perfect is a basic iOS application that allows a user to record their voice and replay it with filters for speed, echo, reverb, and more. This project was completed as part of Udacity's [Intro to iOS App Development with Swift](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-ios-app-development-with-swift--ud585).

Through this tutorial, I learned about UIKit, IBOutlets / IBActions, UINavigationController, Delegates, Stack Views, Autolayout, View Controller Lifecycle, and how to navigate through Xcode.

<h3>Development</h3>

Feel free to clone this repo and examine the code on your local machine. You'll need the latest version of [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/downloads/) in order to run this project.

You can view the project by opening ```PitchPerfect.xcodeproj``` with Xcode.
